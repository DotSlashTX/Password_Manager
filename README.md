Please check session3.py.. Its done...(I hope)

23/12/2020 - Added Encryption and hashing. However I am not sure that it's secure because the decrypter function is in the same place..... It's safe for account password but not for saved passwords.... 

3/01/2021 - Learning GitHub again

26/04/2021 - Fixed major bugs, added Login and Sign Up functionality. 

30/04/2021 - We consider this project complete as of today.

## Notes :
Some material design is yet to be completed, upcoming fuctionalities might include
dark theme toggle button (if possible).
We will try to keep this app as user friendly as possible.

Try to break this app and stress test it as much as possible.
